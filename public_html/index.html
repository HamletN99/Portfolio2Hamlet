        Pasadena High School. I am a 9th grader. I am in the App Academy 
        because I wanna explore different options a lot so I can know what
        direction I am going to go with my life and what I like to know to

          I am learning in the App Academy how to use HTML and exploring what
          it can do and features and how it all works as coding. We learn about
          CSS that how to make the web site more nicer and better looking and 
          how to customize like backgrounds and more. We are now learning a 
          new way of coding called bootstrap it helps you with adding features
          that are very different and more professional and those features you
          would see would blow your mind.
